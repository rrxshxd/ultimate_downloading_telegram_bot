# üöÄ Ultimate Downloading Telegram Bot

I got tired of Telegram download bots that require subscriptions to suspicious channels
and online websites full of ads and shady redirect links, so I decided to create a bot of my own.
I will be adding support for downloading from other platforms later on. Currently, you can use it to download from **YouTube**, **TikTok** and **Instagram**.
The bot is free to use and does **not** require any subscriptions to other channels.

## ‚ú® Features
- üì• Download videos from **YouTube**, **TikTok**, and **Instagram**
- ‚ö° Fast(almost, will look forward to make it faster), ad-free, and no subscriptions required
- üõ†Ô∏è Planned support for additional platforms

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT NOTE:
I do **NOT** use this bot to steal anyone's content. I just browse the web, and if I find a video cool or funny, I upload it to my telegram story without claiming it as my own. If someone from my viewers asks me for the source, I always provide a link to the original content.

## How to install
If you want to install this bot, follow these steps:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rrxshxd/ultimate_telegram_download_bot.git
cd ultimate_telegram_download_bot
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Configuration
**Create a .env file with your Telegram bot token(look up how to get your Telegram bot token [here](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial))**
Example of .env file:
`TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_token_here`

**Run the bot**
```bash
python bot.py
```
